# 750-words

750 words is a recreational project developed in order to have a real free mind when practicing free-writting as explained in the book "The Artist's Way" by Julia Cameron or in [this article](https://betterhumans.pub/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd).

> This project is by no means a commercial copy of the 750 words website. It is a personal project developed to reassure myself that I can write in trusty way whatever I have in mind in an app I know I can trust because I developed it myself.

## Installation

npm i
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

```

Contributing to the project is very welcome. Please refer to the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
